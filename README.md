Simple MVC Application I made to learn and better understand MVC.

It's Pet Management app with simple login/register system, connected remotely to ClearDB, locally I used MSSQL.
It's far from perfect, but it taught me basics of MVC and that's exactly what it's purpose was.

I didn't put a lot of effort into making it visually beautiful, though I used MVC Templates and Bootstrap to make it look somewhat appealing.
I hosted it on heroku, you can try it here: https://pets-mvc.herokuapp.com
